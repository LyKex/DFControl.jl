TODO:
    -> Implement error checking!

TODO: Structure, Atom
    -> What we might want to do instead of just adding more fields to Atom and Structure is to have an abstract type Atom, and then a WanAtom and ControlAtom or something similar. And same for the structure. That way we can keep the two packages kind off disentangled, and just have a ControlAtom field in the WanAtom field. This seems a good idea.
